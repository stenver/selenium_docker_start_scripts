# Selenium docker start scripts

This is a repository that has simple wrappers for starting [Selenium dockers](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium)

To start up the hub:
```
./start_hub.sh
```

To start any of the browsers, run as many times as needed:
```
./start_chrome.sh
./start_firefox.sh
```
